## About

The Ethereum Foundation is launching a fellowship-style grant program to support Ethereum-related academic work led by **current PhD students**. Selected Fellows will receive **$24,000 USD** over **one year**, intended as a supplement to their existing stipend, with **12 Fellowships** awarded in total. Proposals are due **23:59 AoE March 23rd, 2026**.

The Ethereum Foundation is sponsoring the 2026 PhD Fellowship Program, a pioneering initiative aimed at empowering and expanding the frontiers of Ethereum-related academic research. We welcome proposals across the following disciplines, including **Institutional Design, Governance, Political Economy, Policy Studies, and Decentralized AI**. Through this effort, we aim to empower researchers to explore new frontiers and deliver impactful work that propels Ethereum forward.

In 2025, our Academic Grants Round received **over 300 applications from researchers across 25 countries**, reflecting the global academic community's growing interest in Ethereum. The breadth and quality of submissions were exceptional. Building on that momentum, the 2026 PhD Fellowship Program is designed to support a smaller, more targeted cohort - **exemplary PhD students with a proven track record of producing rigorous, high-impact research**.

We are seeking proposals that align with the **RFP topics listed below**. We encourage researchers to use these RFPs as a starting point, and to think creatively about how their work can generate meaningful insights and contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Requirements

- All applicants must be actively enrolled in a PhD Program from a university or academic institute.
- Projects must produce formal academic research published in venues such as conferences or journals.
- Research output must be open-access with a free and permissive license.
- All applications must have a written proposal in PDF format:
  - Proposals must be in English.
  - Proposals must adhere to [this template](https://notes.ethereum.org/@s_VsCoN-RHCQdMf6bFLJ8g/H1Tsh8sSWx).
  - Proposals must include an applicant profile.
  - Proposals must include a public repository or link to published work.
- Applications are selected for funding on a case-by-case basis. You may submit more than one application as long as each proposal is unique and meets the requirements of the RFP item that they're linked to.
- Decisions will be emailed 6 weeks after the application deadline.

## Deadline

The application window opens on **Monday, February 2nd, 2026** and closes on **Monday, March 23rd, 2026**.

## Selection criteria

Applications are selected on a case-by-case basis. Submissions will be reviewed using the following considerations. Note: depending on the proposal, some criteria might not be applicable:

- Impact of the proposed research output
- Quality of work and experience of the applicant and their supervisor
- Clarity, conciseness, and organization of the proposal
- Potential of long-term involvement in the Ethereum ecosystem
- Translatability of research that helps a non-technical audience gain insight into the output

## Fellowship details

Please note that this fellowship provides **USD 24,000** in funding over **one year**, intended as a **supplement** to the PhD candidate's existing stipend. At the conclusion of the fellowship, selected scholars may be eligible for a **continuity stipend** to support further development of their project beyond the initial one-year period. Eligibility for this additional support is contingent on the **quality of the work** and the **overall success of the project**.
