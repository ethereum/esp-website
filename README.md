  Ethereum Ecosystem Support Program
</h1>

The Ethereum Ecosystem Support Program exists to provide both financial and non-financial support to projects and entities within the greater Ethereum community, in order to accelerate the growth of the ecosystem. The Ecosystem Support Program is an expansion of the original Ethereum Grants Program which mainly focused on financial support. Our focus is on deploying our resources where they will have the biggest impact.

This repository holds the codebase to our website, [esp.ethereum.foundation](https://esp.ethereum.foundation)

## Stack

This is the main stack used in the project:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- TypeScript
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as component library
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) to validate forms
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to animate buttons

## Local development

This is a v project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learning NextJS

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Adding ChakraUI to a NextJS project

[This](https://chakra-ui.com/guides/getting-started/nextjs-guide) is a very clear and step-by-step guide on it.

## Learning ChakraUI

We recommend checking the [official docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started).
