### Introduction

The Ecosystem Support Program in collaboration with **Aztec**, **Scroll**, **Taiko** and **ZkSync** is launching this grants initiative to encourage research and development for Zero-Knowledge proofs and standards for ZK L2s. This collaborative grants round is a first for the Ecosystem Support Program and will draw on both the funding support and the technical expertize of the participating L2s. Each of the funders is contributing **$150K** to the shared prize pool that totals **$750k**.

### Ideas

These are some high level topics, please review the entire wishlist for a complete list of ideas.

- Performance benchmarking (prover time, verifier time, proof size) for different types of proof systems as well as prover/verifier client implementations
- ZK DevX and further improvement in efficiency and ergonomics of ZK-DSLs & associated libraries + tooling
- Publicly accessible and easy-to-understand security and risk benchmarking for ZKRs and bridges (a la L2beat)
- Forced inclusion tools and frontend(?) for ZK and validity-proof based L2s
- zkDSL\<>Solidity transpilers
- Hardware acceleration
- Multi-prover systems (validity/ZK + fraud proof)

### FAQ

<Accordion allowToggle>
  <FAQItem question='Does the Ethereum Foundation have an Indirect Costs Policy?'>
      ESP has an [indirect costs policy for Academic Grants](/Academic_Grants_Round_-_Indirect_Costs_Guide.pdf).
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question='Who can submit proposals for Academic Grants Round?'>
    Academic institutions, consortia of universities, research centres, universities, think-tanks and
    individuals with prior research experience.
  </FAQItem>
  <FAQItem question='What makes for a good proposal?'>
    In short, we need enough information to understand your goals, the research
    problem you&apos;re aiming to tackle, the academic output, information on
    previous research work, who&apos;s involved and estimation regarding time
    and budget. The more details you provide, the more likely we&apos;ll be able
    to help.

    For example:
    - Clearly showing the research area you&apos;re digging into.
    - Outlining the output. Is it a research paper or lab work that will culminate in an experimental report?
    - Clearly stating the impact your research will have and how you foresee your findings being used by the Ethereum community.
    - Detailed description of your project, milestones, the people involved and how much time you think it will take to complete.
