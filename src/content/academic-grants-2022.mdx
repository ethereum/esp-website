<MdSummary>

**We're calling all those interested in expanding academic knowledge throughout the Ethereum ecosystem!**

The Ethereum community has grown immensely as developers, artists, companies, and even governments work together to make a positive impact with this technology.

With this grants round, the Ethereum Foundation welcomes more academics to the table to push forward formal academic research in related domains. Such domains include theoretical and applied cryptography and mathematics, zero-knowledge proofs, economics, computation, cybersecurity, protocol and consensus mechanisms, formal verification, P2P networking, and hardware, just to mention a few areas.

The Ethereum Foundation is excited to expand Ethereum's reach across more of academia through this grants round.

</MdSummary>

### Submit proposal

Individual researchers with academic backgrounds, research centers, universities, think-tanks, educators and other stakeholders interested in research on matters related to Ethereum and its ecosystem are encouraged to apply.

Anyone is free to participate in this grants round, as an individual or with a team.

Research outputs are encouraged but not limited to the following [wishlist](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/academic-grants-2022).

We welcome research at any stage, whether it's a new idea based on the wishlist, a project that furthers Ethereum-related research you've already undertaken, or a lab experiment.

Grants will be awarded on a case-by-case and rolling basis. You may enter more than one proposal as long as each proposal is unique and meets the [the requirements](#requirements).

### Deadline

The deadline has been extended. Submit by **May 8, 2022**. We will follow-up regarding your submission by email.

### Requirements

- Proposals must be in English.
- Work must be open source.
- Reports must be accessible by a url.

### Selection criteria

**Surprise us with your creativity!** But here are a few selection criteria considerations:

- Impact of the proposed research output.
- Quality of work and experience of the research team.
- Clarity, conciseness and organization of the proposal.
- Contribution to the wishlist areas.
- Potential of long-term involvement in the Ethereum ecosystem.
- Analyses or visualizations that help a non-technical audience gain insight into the research.

### Wishlist

The Ethereum Foundation is interested in research and academic output in the following domain areas, but don't let this restrict your creativity. Check out our [wishlist](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/academic-grants-2022).

### Frequently asked questions

<Accordion allowToggle>
  <FAQItem question='Who can submit proposals for Academic Grants Round?'>
      Academic institutions, consortia of universities, research centres,
      universities, think-tanks and individuals with prior research experience.
  </FAQItem>

  <FAQItem question='What makes for a good proposal?'>
    In short, we need enough information to understand your goals, the research
    problem you&apos;re aiming to tackle, the academic output, information on
    previous research work, who&apos;s involved and estimation regarding time
    and budget. The more details you provide, the more likely we&apos;ll be able
    to help.

    For example:

    - Clearly showing the research area you're digging into.
    - Outlining the output. Is it a research paper or lab work that will culminate in an experimental report?
    - Clearly stating the impact your research will have and how you foresee your findings being used by the Ethereum community.
    - Detailed description of your project, milestones, the people involved and how much time you think it will take to complete.
