                      <PageText>
                        This is the second time the Ethereum Foundation is launching a specific
                        grant round to support Ethereum related academic research. We also have an
                        ongoing support program - the Ecosystem Support Program - which supports
                        Ethereum related projects in various scopes.

                    <FAQItem question='Are applications evaluated on a rolling basis or at the end of the deadline?'>
                      <PageText>
                        Project submission will be evaluated after the deadline, and contact will be
                        made with each applicant to inform them about the evaluation outcome.

                    <FAQItem question='Can I submit more than one application, or should I combine all the project ideas into one sole application?'>
                      <PageText>
                        You should submit one application per project idea/ wishlist area. Multiple
                        applications per institution are accepted for the Academic Grants Round.
                        Submitting duplicates or variants of the same application will not improve
                        your chances of selection.
