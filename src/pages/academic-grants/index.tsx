                    The Ethereum Foundation is thrilled to announce the Academic Grants Round 2024,
                    an initiative dedicated to fostering research in the Ethereum ecosystem.
                    Following the overwhelming success of the 2023 round, where we funded 43
                    projects from 20 countries, we are eager to continue supporting the academic
                    contributions. With a focus on a wide array of domains such as, cryptography,
                    mathematics, zero-knowledge proofs, economics, computation, cybersecurity,
                    protocol and consensus mechanisms, formal verification, P2P networking, society
                    and regulation, and hardware, we aim to catalyze research that propels the
                    Ethereum ecosystem forward.

                    In 2023, we received an astounding 250 applications, emphasizing the global
                    academic communityâ€™s growing interest in Ethereum. The diversity and quality of
                    these applications were remarkable. This year, we aim to build on this momentum
                    by inviting even more researchers and institutions from more countries to
                    participate. By sponsoring this wave of grants, the Ethereum Foundation
                    underscores its commitment to supporting rigorous academic work that addresses
                    key challenges and unlocks new opportunities.

                        We are aiming to receive academic and formal research outputs, be it a
                        research paper, an experimental report or some sort of comprehensive
                        research output. Whatever the output, the information should be open-source
                        and available for the broader community to use. The Intellectual Property
                        can still be owned by the research team, but it is key that the output is
                        open source.
