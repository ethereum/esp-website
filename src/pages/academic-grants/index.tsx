                    The Ethereum Foundation is thrilled to announce the Academic Grants Round 2024,
                    an initiative dedicated to fostering research in the Ethereum ecosystem.
                    Following the overwhelming success of the 2023 round, where we funded 43
                    projects from 20 countries, we are eager to continue supporting academic
                    contributions. With a focus on a wide array of domains such as, applied and
                    theoretical cryptography, economics, game theory, security, consensus protocols,
                    formal verification, p2p networking, society and regulation, and hardware, we
                    aim to catalyze research that propels the Ethereum ecosystem forward.

                  <PageText>
                    In 2023, we received an astounding 250 applications, which highlighted the
                    global academic communityâ€™s growing interest in Ethereum. This year, we aim to
                    build on this momentum by inviting even more researchers and institutions from
                    more countries to participate. Through this wave of grants, the Ethereum
                    Foundation underscores its commitment to supporting rigorous academic work that
                    addresses key challenges and unlocks new opportunities.

                      <PageText>
                        We are aiming to receive academic and formal research outputs, be it a
                        research paper, an experimental report or some sort of comprehensive
                        research output. Whatever the output, the information should be open-source
                        and available for the broader community to use. The Intellectual Property
                        can still be owned by the research team, but it is key that the output is
                        open source.
