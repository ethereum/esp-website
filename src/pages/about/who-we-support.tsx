            ESP funding is generally directed toward supporting builders rather than directly
            impacting end users. We don&apos;t often fund dapps or front-end platforms, although
            this is not a hard rule and there are exceptions - for example, where an application
            serves as a research or educational tool, or a reference implementation of a new
            standard.

          <PageText mb={6}>
            Our grantees come from all over the world and represent many different backgrounds,
            disciplines and levels of experience. We have supported individuals and teams of all
            kinds - companies, DAOs, nonprofits, institutions, academics, developers, educators,
            community organizers and more.
