    "mission-2": "ESP is an outcome of the expansion of the original Ethereum Foundation Grants Program, which focused mainly on funding. ESP's open inquiry process is designed to connect individuals and teams at any stage of development with a broad range of support, whether that means grants, technical feedback, introductions, free access to tools and platforms, or even just a friendly conversation and a nudge in the right direction.",

    },
    "grant": {
      "question": "Does the Ecosystem Support Program still give grants?",
      "answer-p-1": "Yes! Awarding grants continues to be an important tool for us; but impact often takes more than just money, so we/ve expanded the range of support we provide. Our goal is to take an individual approach to each project, working together to establish realistic goals and offering support targeted to facilitate those goals."
    },
    "eligibility": {
      "question": "Who can apply?",
      "answer-p-1": "We don’t accept grant applications directly through our website, but rather invite interested parties to get in touch through our",
      "answer-p-2": "Newcomers to Ethereum, established projects, and past grantees are all welcome to submit an inquiry. Consider this inquiry the start of a conversation, and we’ll help you decide whether applying for a grant or other support is the right next step for you."
    },
    "eligibility-2": {
      "question": "Is anyone *not* eligible for the Ecosystem Support Program?",
      "answer-p-1": "Anyone is welcome to apply for support, but the specific types of support available may vary. We typically provide grants funding for proposals that provide open-source software, research, community building or other contributions expected to have a positive impact on the ecosystem and community as a whole. We are happy to work with for-profit entities that are contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem, although clearly commercial projects (including any project that has recently raised or plans to raise ICO or venture investment) are likely to be better suited to receive non-financial support.",
      "answer-p-2": "Even if your overall project or business is not eligible for grant funding, it’s still worth getting in touch! We may be able to provide other types of assistance, and in some cases specific subcomponents or research challenges may be eligible for financial support."
    },
    "topics": {
      "question": "What types of projects are you interested in?",
      "answer-p-1": "Some areas we’ve focused on so far include:",
      "answer-li-1": "Research (e.g. cryptography, MPC computational models, privacy, proof systems, Eth2 challenges)",
      "answer-li-2": "Protocol improvements (e.g optimisations, contributions to sharding, light clients)",
      "answer-li-3": "L2 solutions (e.g. Plasma, State channels, Rollup)",
      "answer-li-4": "Community resources (e.g. documentation, tutorials, forums, groups, outreach)",
      "answer-li-5": "Open source tooling (e.g IDEs, testing tools, static analysis tools, debuggers)",
      "answer-li-6": "Public good infrastructure (e.g. messaging, storage, compute)",
      "answer-li-7": "Interoperability (e.g. with other protocols and services)",
      "answer-li-8": "Building blocks & Libraries",
      "answer-p-2": "More generally, we look for transformational concepts, broad impact, and initiatives that address clear needs in the ecosystem. Don’t feel constrained by these lists - thinking outside the box is encouraged!"
    },
    "applications": {
      "question": "What makes a good application?",
      "answer-p-1": "While we don’t take grant applications directly through our website, thorough and thoughtful responses to the questions on our inquiry form can start the process off right. When submitting an inquiry, we want to know who you are, what you’re trying to do and what issues you’re facing.",
      "answer-p-2": "Adding detailed information to your inquiry will increase your chances of getting a useful and timely response. Some common causes of delay include:",
      "answer-li-1": "Unclear impact (insufficient focus on how your project would help the Ethereum ecosystem)",
      "answer-li-2": "Unclear project description (insufficient technical description of what you are building)",
      "answer-li-3": "Unclear needs/challenges (insufficient reflection on what stands between you and your goals)",
      "answer-p-3": "We need enough information to understand your goals, your motivation and your challenges. The more detail you provide at this stage, the more likely we’ll be able to help."
    },
    "millions": {
      "question": "Will you give me a million dollars?",
      "answer-p-1": "Probably not. Grant sizes vary widely depending on the scope and expected length of the project - anywhere from $5,000 USD for an individual tackling a distinct task or research problem, to $200k+ for dedicated Eth 2 client teams working on a multi-year timeline. Grant applicants will have the opportunity to work with the ESP team on determining an appropriate request based on the scope of their proposed work."
    },
    "application-process": {
      "question": "What happens after an inquiry is submitted?",
      "answer-p-1": "You’ll be assigned a guide, who will be a consistent point of contact to help you navigate the process. There will be an initial conversation and peer review to determine whether the program is a good fit for your project and what types of support might be most appropriate. If it seems like a fit, you’ll enter the next phase of formally applying for a grant, exploring other resources, or both. Whichever track(s) you embark on, your guide will be with you every step of the way. The more detail you provide in your initial inquiry, the smoother and quicker the process of determining next steps can go. See “What makes a good application” above for more on this."
    },
    "response-time": {
      "question": "How long will it take before I hear back from you?",
      "answer-p-1": "You should hear from us within a few days of submitting your inquiry. If your inquiry progresses to a grant application, the overall process may take a few weeks to a few months depending on the scope and complexity of your project. You can help us move the process along by providing as much detail as possible in your initial inquiry (see 'What makes a good application' above)."
    },
    "confidentiality": {
      "question": "Is my application confidential?",
      "answer-p-1": "Any information you provide may be shared in the peer-review process, so let us know in your application if there's anything you want us to keep private!"
    },
    "payment": {
      "question": "Can grants be paid out in ETH?",
